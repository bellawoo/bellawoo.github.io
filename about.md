Hi, I'm Bella and I live in Washington, DC. Currently, I work at The Atlantic as a Platform Developer. In this role, I build software that supports journalism concerned with the most consequential issues of our day, [of no party or clique](https://www.theatlantic.com/history/).

Previously, I was at [Dharma](https://www.dharma.ai/), working with renowned data scientists on a SaaS, turning user-collected data into meaningful and mathematically sound insights, in real-time. And before that, I was an Application Support Engineer at [Teaching Strategies](https://teachingstrategies.com/), an early childhood education company.

I have been lucky enough to discover an occupation that thrills me and to apply those skills at companies with missions to make the world a better place.

Prior to coding, I watched from the sidelines as a digital project manager for a variety of digital and advertising agencies.
