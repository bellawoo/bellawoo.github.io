Hi, I'm Bella and I live in Washington, DC. Currently, I work at [Dharma](https://www.dharma.ai/) where I have the title of Software Engineer, Data Science. Day in and day out, I'm working with renowned data scientists to turn our users' data into meaningful and mathematically sound insights, all in real-time.

Previously, I was an Application Support Engineer at [Teaching Strategies](https://teachingstrategies.com/), an early childhood education company.

I have been lucky enough to discover an occupation that thrills me and to apply those skills at companies with missions to make the world a better place.

Prior to coding, I watched from the sidelines as a digital project manager for a variety of digital and advertising agencies.
