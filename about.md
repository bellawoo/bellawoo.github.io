<p>Hi, I'm Bella and I'm a web developer from Washington, DC. Currently, I work at Teaching Strategies, an early childhood education company, as an Application Support Engineer.</p>
<p>When the sun is up, I'm mucking through databases and crafting up SQL queries to solve problems. When the sun is down, I'm hacking away at toy projects and making small contributions to open source projects in Ruby. Holler at me if you have ideas for a new project!</p>
<p>Prior to coding, I watched from the sidelines as a digital project manager for a variety of digital and advertising agencies.</p>
