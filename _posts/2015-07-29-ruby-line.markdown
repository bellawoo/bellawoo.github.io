The Ruby Line is an app that shows you the upcoming WMATA metrorail arrivals, nearby Bikeshare dock information, and WMATA metrorail and Uber fare estimates.

The Ruby Line has evolved over three stages. A small feature set was originally assigned as a partnership with the Front-End Engineering course at The Iron Yard DC. In this first release, the API was built in Sinatra.

The second iteration came as a second partnership with the iOS Development course at The Iron Yard DC. For this assignment, the project was to be refactored for iOS front-end consumption and imported into Rails.

This project was refactored once again and added a fare calculator feature. In total, this API mashes up five different public APIs. There was also a switch from conventional Rails framework to using the rails-api gem (which will be folded into Rails 5 core) to cut down on the unecessary middleware. The latest version of the API is currently [deployed on Heroku](https://rubyline.herokuapp.com/). Source code for all three versions are on Github.
