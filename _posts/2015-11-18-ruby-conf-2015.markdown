<p>Not quite a project, but still noteworthy. In November 2015, I had the honor of attending Ruby Conf 2015 as an Opportunity Scholar. As a scholar, I was attended the conference as a VIP (hello, front row seats to all keynotes), was matched up with a [mentor](http://www.benjaminfleischer.com/), and received moral and technial support from Ruby Central staff and other mentors. I was interviewed by video folks doing a recap documentary of the conference, was able to attend a session given by the person who wrote the first coding tutorial I'd ever taken, lift weights with Sandi Metz, meet fellow The Iron Yard family members, meet Matz, get to know a fantastic group of aspiring Rubyists and beg Tenderlove for stickets of his cats.</p>
