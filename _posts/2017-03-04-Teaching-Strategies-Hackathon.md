The inaugural hackathon at Teaching Strategies was a great success! I formed a team with my fellow App Support Engineer to build a utility tool that would ease one of our more time consuming and dreaded tasks.

Our hackathon project was an executable utilizing Traveling Ruby to bundle up shell scripts that would allow our integrated clients to update their data regardless of hardware and operating system or technical knowledge. The executable included basic data validation and CSV linting, to reduce load on the main application should the project ever be accepted for further development as a full fledged feature.
