Jungle Books is a personal Ruby on Rails project built for my book club. A designated host can suggest books by searching through Amazon's catalog and members can vote on them. Users are shown book details from Amazon API and can read reviews from Amazon customers without having to leave the app. A true conception to deployment effort by me, the front-end was handled with the help of Bootstrap. The app uses Devise for authorization and is currently [deployed on Heroku](https://junglebooks.herokuapp.com/).
