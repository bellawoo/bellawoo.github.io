Peace Corps Medlink is a project resulting from National Day of Civic Hacking, sponsored by the White House, that makes it easier for Peace Corps volunteers to order needed medical supplies. You can learn more about the app on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/uNkwizhzMVA). My Iron Yard instructor, James Dabbs, is a lead developer on the project. I assist in issue resolution and feature development under his guidance. All code is public on [GitHub](https://github.com/PeaceCorps/medlink).
