Technica is the University of Maryland's all-women hackathon. In the year that I participated, Technica became the largest all-women hackathon event with over 850 participants. I served as a mentor, getting flagged down to answer questions, guiding teams through product design and even providing last-minute testing. My best moment at the event was assisting a team of high-school seniors that had built a game with Unity, featuring a pair of world-saving-fishnet-wearing-high-heel-stompin mannequin legs as its antagonist, get their work up onto Github just in time to qualify for judging.
