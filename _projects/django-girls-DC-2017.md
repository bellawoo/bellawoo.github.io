Django Girls is a non-profit organization that hosts workshops around the world to spread the Python love and foster safe learning spaces for women.

I was selected to participate in their 2017 Washington DC workshop. I spent the day working on my first nose-to-tail Django implementation and bugging my coach about syntatical differences on the uses of parentheses. I also got the chance to help explain some Python and OOP concepts to some of the less-experienced attendees, allowing me to practice articulating general programming concepts in spoken form.
