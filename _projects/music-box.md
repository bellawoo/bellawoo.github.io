Music Box is a group project by The Iron Yard's Ruby on Rails Engineering May 2015 cohort. Users are invited to the app where they can suggest songs to add to a group playlist. Songs can then be previewed and voted on for the culminating playlist. Songs are indexed via the Spotify API. During this project, I paired with two different classmates to build the song search feature and an administrative user dashboard. Uses HTTParty to access Spotify API data and TDD was done with Minitest. Originally built in Sinatra, the Rails version can be viewed on [Github](https://github.com/TIY-DC-ROR-2015-May/MusicBoxOnRails).
